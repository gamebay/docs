# Ranks

A default Gamebay installation comes with pre-defined ranks: 

  - Bronze, xp<100
  - Silver, 100<=xp<200 
  - Gold, 200<=xp<300
  - Diamond, 300<=xp<400
  - Master, 400<=xp

## Experience

Experience is a number associated with each user that holds information about the users rank. Every rank brings some benefit to the user (higher ranks brings more benefits). 

Experience is naturally decaying with a configurable factor. This means that users will have to play in order to keep(and advance) their ranks.
Gamebay also provides a special item in the shop: Freeze XP. This item allows to user to not lose XP during a time period(time period varies based on coins spent).
