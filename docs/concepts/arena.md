# Arena

The arena is a physical location where users can hang out and play with their friends.

An arena can work in standalone mode or as part of a cluster (franchise).

## Coin rate
Every arena defines a base coin rate users have to pay in exchange for playing.

## Bonuses
Users can receive various bonuses which lower their coin rate, which in turn lowers their cost of play.

## Passes
A pass is a virtual ticket that authorizes the holder to play in the arena until it expires.
